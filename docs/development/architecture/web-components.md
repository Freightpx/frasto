description: When reusable client behavior warrants a custom element—and when it does not.
---

Web Components are an interaction tool, not the default format for every Frasto component.

## Use a custom element when

- behavior must be reusable across several Astro render locations
- multiple instances need isolated initialization
- lifecycle callbacks materially simplify setup and cleanup
- properties, attributes, and events form a useful browser-facing contract

## Do not use one when

- HTML and CSS already solve the component
- a short page-local enhancement is clearer
- the element would only provide styling
- shadow DOM would obstruct product composition or theming without a strong benefit

## Light DOM first

Prefer light DOM for Frasto UI so semantic content, form participation, CSS tokens, and application composition stay straightforward. Shadow DOM needs a specific encapsulation reason.

## Contract

Custom elements must handle repeated connection safely, remove global listeners when disconnected, expose documented events, and avoid silently owning remote data or application state.
