description: Frasto's strict zero-radius geometry for precise application interfaces.
---

Frasto uses square geometry throughout its application UI. Shape does not change by component size or containment level.

## Token

```css
--frasto-radius: 0px;
```

## Rules

- Buttons, inputs, selects, textareas, checkboxes, switches, slider tracks and thumbs, badges, icon buttons, menus, cards, dialogs, and drawers use `0px` radius.
- Do not add rounded or pill variants to the core component API.
- Status and selection rely on typography, borders, fills, icons, or indicators—not shape changes.
- Media supplied by an application should not be clipped into a rounded shape by Frasto.

## Responsive behavior

Square geometry remains unchanged across breakpoints and themes.
