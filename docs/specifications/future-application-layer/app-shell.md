title: AppShell
description: Planned application frame for identity, navigation, utilities, and primary content.

**Status: Planned**

`AppShell` establishes the stable frame around application routes without owning routing or authentication.

## Anatomy

1. application identity
2. primary navigation region
3. optional top navigation or utility region
4. primary content region
5. optional account actions

## Composition

The shell should accept authored navigation and content rather than requiring a remote menu schema. `Sidebar` is a common companion, not an inseparable internal implementation.

## Accessibility

Use recognizable landmark regions, provide a skip link to main content, and avoid duplicate unnamed navigation landmarks. Mobile open/close controls require accessible names and focus return.

## Responsive behavior

Desktop navigation is typically persistent. At constrained widths it becomes a drawer or another explicit compact mode while main content keeps a reliable reading order.

## Ownership boundary

The application owns routes, active URL resolution, authentication state, and user actions. The shell owns layout and responsive navigation behavior.
