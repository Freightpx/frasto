**Status: Planned**

`SettingsLayout` organizes settings destinations and the active form or information panel.

## Typical structure

```text
Settings
├── General
├── Profile
├── Team
├── Security
├── Notifications
├── Billing
└── API
```

## Desktop

A settings navigation rail sits beside a readable content column. Form width follows the task rather than expanding to the entire viewport.

## Mobile

Navigation may become a select, drawer, or compact segmented list. The current section remains clear and browser history should continue to represent navigation when routes are used.

## Forms

Group related fields under semantic headings. Save actions communicate idle, submitting, success, and error states without losing entered values.

## Accessibility

Navigation identifies the current destination, headings remain logical, errors associate with fields, and sticky save regions do not cover focused controls.

## Ownership

Routing, permissions, validation, and persistence belong to the application.
