**Status: Planned**

`FilterBar` coordinates the controls used to narrow or change a resource view.

## Anatomy

- optional search
- select, status, date, or product-specific filters
- active-filter summary
- clear-all action
- optional result count or saved views

## Ownership

The application owns filter values, URL synchronization, queries, and persistence. The component provides layout and interaction structure.

## Behavior

Applying, removing, and clearing filters must be predictable. A result view should make active criteria visible; hidden state in a closed menu is insufficient.

## Accessibility

Each filter has a label, active values are readable, remove controls name the affected filter, and result updates are announced only when useful.

## Responsive behavior

Primary search may remain visible while secondary filters move into a drawer or disclosure. Active criteria and clear-all behavior must remain available on narrow layouts.
