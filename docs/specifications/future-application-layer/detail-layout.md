**Status: Planned**

`DetailLayout` organizes one resource such as a customer, company, product, invoice, user, or order.

## Anatomy

1. resource identity and status
2. primary actions
3. key information
4. related records
5. activity or history
6. secondary or destructive actions

## Layout

Use a stable primary column for the resource narrative and an optional secondary region for metadata or actions. Avoid dividing every field into an independent card.

## Data states

Define loading, not found, access denied, partial relations, stale data, and mutation feedback. A failure in one related panel should not necessarily replace the entire detail view.

## Responsive behavior

Secondary information stacks into the main reading order. Sticky actions must not obscure content or create unreachable controls on mobile.

## Ownership

The application loads and mutates the resource. The layout provides hierarchy, responsive regions, and predictable placement.
