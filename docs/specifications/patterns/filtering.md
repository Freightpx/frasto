## Filter lifecycle

```text
Choose criterion
    ↓
Apply or update
    ↓
Show active value
    ↓
Update result context
    ↓
Remove one or clear all
```

## Immediate vs applied

Simple local filters may update immediately. Expensive queries or multi-field filter builders may use an Apply action. Do not mix both models without a clear boundary.

## Active criteria

Show values outside a closed menu, especially when they materially change results. Each removable criterion names what will be cleared.

## No results

Keep the active filters visible and offer a reset. Do not present filtered emptiness as if the product has no records at all.

## URLs and backend

The application may serialize filter state to the URL and query any backend. Frasto describes display and interaction; it does not define query syntax.

## Accessibility

Labels, result context, keyboard operation, and focus after removal remain predictable. Avoid excessive live announcements during rapid text entry.
