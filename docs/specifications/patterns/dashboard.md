## Use when

A person needs a fast overview of current state, exceptions, and work that requires attention.

## Structure

```text
PageHeader
Stats
Primary analysis or operational summary
Recent activity
Priority resource list
```

## Hierarchy

Start with the decision the dashboard should support. Stats and charts are not the goal; they are evidence. Keep the most actionable change or exception near the top.

## Charts

Charts remain optional and outside the core dependency set. Provide an accessible summary, visible units, meaningful time range, and non-color distinctions.

## Data states

Regions may load and fail independently. Preserve available sections when one source fails. First-use dashboards should guide setup instead of rendering empty decorative panels.

## Responsive behavior

Stats reduce columns, analysis regions stack, and table content prioritizes essential fields. Preserve source order that matches importance.
